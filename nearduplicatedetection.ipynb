    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll learn how to detect near duplicate comments on rulemakings using MinHash! Before we begin, let's briefly review what we're trying to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a lot of comments on agency rulemakings. For example (and we'll revisit this example throughout), consider the proposed rule entitled [*Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems*](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FAA-2019-1100-0001). Contained within the [docket](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FAA-2019-1100) are 53,211 comments. The comments are mostly plain text, totalling 13,887,832 words—that's 23 times as long as *War and Peace* (587,287 words) and 12 times as long as the entire *Harry Potter* series (1,084,170 words). An average college student, reading at [450 words per minute](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettnelson/2012/06/04/do-you-read-fast-enough-to-be-successful/#5863fed2462e), would need just over 514 hours to read all the comments (that's 13 full work weeks!). And this doesn't even count attachments, of which there are 6,915. However, because any type of file can be attached, they're rather hard to process, and we'll ignore them for our purposes. Bottom line: there's a lot of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, whether you're a lone academic looking to understand commenting behavior, or the FAA attempting to respond to these comments, you'd be wise to employ some sort of automatic technology to sort through, organize, analyze, and understand these comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common pattern of comments is the *form comment*. These are comments that are substantially identical. They likely started life as a form—as in, a mostly complete document to be filled out. Then, either a human or a computer came through and filled out the form, customizing the comment somewhat. Large organizations sometimes organize mass comment campaigns—they draft form comments and distribute them to their memberships, who then fill in their names and perhaps slightly customize the comments in other ways and submit them as individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any number of reasons, we might want to identify and isolate groups of form comments (and there will be groups—sometimes there are multiple interested institutions, other times a single institution prepares multiple forms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to state the problem is that we want to find *near duplicates*—form comments are rarely exact duplicates, they're defintionally forms that are filled out and customized. But, as with any sort of form, much of the text remains unchanged. Thus, while they may not be exact textual duplicates, they are near duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will introduce several key principles and techniques of natural language processing (NLP) in a informal, intuitive style. In the process, we'll learn a bit about how computers work, and the various challenges one might face during an NLP project (i.e., a project that involves analyzing human language, like English). Note, however, that many of the ideas discussed here can be applied across many domains, even outside the natural langauge processing context. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is written for people with minimal technical and mathematical ability. There will be math, and there will be code. But we'll first develop an intuitive, conceptual understanding of how things work. Then we'll look at the code and the equations—take a careful look, but if it's beyond you, you can still proceed without substantially harming your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code you see here is real, working Python code. Feel free to change it and run it! Even if you don't know how to program, take a look at the code—some of it may be more comprehensible than you'd expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set up three very basic comments. Later on, we'll look at some real-deal comments. But, for now, it'll be easier to work with shorter comments."

    "## How Computers Work, Part I: How They See Data\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that, to us, text often has rich semantic meaning, like in the comments above.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, to a computer, text is just a bunch of meaningless numbers. Computers, by themselves, know nothing of the world. They see no meaning in text. For example, within computer memory, the word \"HI\" would be stored as 72 73 (when [encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)—basically a matter of looking up each text character in a standardized table that maps from characters to numbers). Or, if you prefer [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), 01001000 01001001. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the purpose of this notebook is not to teach about [positional numeral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system#Positional_systems_in_detail), it's worth knowing that binary is just another way of writing numbers (no different than, say, tick marks or Roman numerals in that respect). All those \"1s and 0s\" (or, more practically, high and low voltages) flowing around inside your computer—they're all just numbers. Of course, they often represent different things. This includes data, like Boolean values (true/false), text, images, sounds, and so forth. And it also includes [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_function) (e.g., AND, as in: true AND false is false) and [arithmetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Arithmetic_operations) (e.g., +, as in: 1 + 2 is 3) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also true of our comments here. Take comment A for example. We can view its numerical representation in both decimal and binary:"

    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard first step in any natural language project is [preprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pre-processing)—preparing the text of each \"document\" (each comment) in the \"corpus\" (the collection of all comments).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic notion of preprocessing is straightforward. Before we do any analysis, we need to get the data into a usable form. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to account for the limitations of computers:\n",
    "- Remember, computers will view \"HI\" and \"hi\" as two entirely different pairs of numbers (72 73 and 104 105, respectively, under ASCII). Thus, we might want to control for case (for example, by converting all text to lower case).\n",
    "- We need to account for various oddities that may appear in the data (for example, when handling strings in computers, it's not uncommon to see [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character) represented as text—for example rather than a paragraph break, you might see the character \"\\n\"). And, thanks to the advent of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), one can have all kinds of odd characters, like 🦄, 🀚, and 🝒. These might not add much meaning and can be inconvenient to work with, so we might want to strip them away entirely.\n",
    "- We need to account for misspellings of words (again \"appearance\" and \"apperence\" will be represented differently within the computer, and the computer will not grasp any semantic connection between the two in the way we might). \n",
    "- We need to account for the fact that some words mean have virtually identical semantic meanings and similar grammatical roles (like \"is,\" \"are,\" and \"be\"). An easy way to get the computer to see them as the same is to, well, make them the same! This might be accomplished via [lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)—it sounds fancy, but lemmatizers basically work by looking up each word in a database to see if it should be mapped to a \"lemma\" or \"dictionary form\" (i.e., the simplest version of the word). Similarly, we might want to perform [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)—a less elegant but more extensible approach that involves converting words to their stems by chopping off the common inflectional prefixes and sufixes (like \"-ing\" from verbs).\n",
    "\n",
    "While preprocessing, we also often perform *tokenization*. We split the text into minimal units of meaning, which we call \"tokens,\" so that each token can be internally represented by a single number. We've seen that, by default, computers see strings of text as strings of numbers. \"Hi\" is understood by the computer as consisting of two numbers stored next to each other in memory: \"H\" (encoded as 72) and \"i\" (encoded as 105). It's often more useful if the numbers within the computer can represent whole words (i.e., units of meaning), rather than characters. A natural solution is to split text at each space, and assign the resultant words to numbers. But, then, is better to understand \"isn't\" as a single token (\"isn't\") or as two (\"is\" and \"n't\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also need to account for the human element. What are we trying to accomplish? How are humans producing and modifying the text at issue? If, say, we have two comments that read \"Hi, I have a comment\" and \"hi, i have a comment\"—is it fair to say these are form comments that we would want to group together? Perhaps if, between two comments, the words use different cases, spellings, inflections, and so forth, then they are in fact not form comments as we would conventionally think of them. Perhaps it's just a matter of (some degree of) design convergence between two bespoke comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, because we are looking for portions of identical text in form comments, it's reasonable to take a light touch during the preprocessing phase. To make some of the visualizations that follow a bit cleaner, we'll just convert everything to lower case, strip all control characters, strip all non-ASCII characters (like the Unicode 🦄), strip all punctuation, and tokenize into words by splitting the text at each space."

    "The value of the *n*-gram lies in its capturing some of the context around each word. Words have semantic value—meaning—on their own. But context, structure, grammar, and word order all greatly bear on the meaning of text. An *n*-gram captures (some) word order. For our purposes, we want to make sure that comments not only use some of the same words, but use them in some of the same orders before we declare them near duplicates.\n",

    "A related and important concept is that of the [*bag of words*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model). Many NLP techniques treat documents as [\"bags\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) of words. Simply stated, given a document, we ignore the structure and order of words—the algorithm treats the document as an unordered list of all its words. If a word appears multiple times in the document, then it appears multiple times in the list. But the list is like an actual bag: devoid of any internal structure or order—all the words from the document, all jumbled up. Many of these techniques can be enhanced by using *n*-grams, rather than words, as tokens (creating a bag of *n*-grams).\n",

We can generate a list of all *k*-grams for a document, but that list will include some duplicate *k*-grams. But, in a mathematical [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), all the elements must be unique. In other words, if there are two identical *k*-grams, we must remove one of them.

    "There's really only one question: how long should our shingles be? Stated fully in the jargon, what value of *k* should we select in generating the *k*-shinglings of our comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind this will become clearer as we move to Step Two and examine the Jaccard index. In the meantime, suffice to say that we want shingles that are sufficiently long that they rarely appear in comments. Lots of comments use the same words (unigrams or 1-shingles). But fewer comments will reuse longer strings of contiguous words, and where they do, it's a stronger indication that we've identified a near duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our test comments are very short, we'll use 2-shinglings (as a practical matter, these are also convenient to understand and visualize later on). Picking a greater *k*, however, would not be unreasonable. For our real-deal, full-length comments, a greater *k* would almost certainly be preferable."

    "## Step Two: MinHash, Part I (The Jaccard Index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step two will be the most challenging part of our work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we think about how to find groups of near-duplicate comments, let's consider how we might determine whether two comments are near duplicates. If there is a means of measuring how similar two comments are, then, if the measure exceeds some threshold, we might declare them similar enough to be near duplicates. What options are there for measuring the similarity of two comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "One option for measuring the similarity between two sets is the Jaccard index (also called the \"Jaccard similarity\"). And, remember, we've decided to treat our comments as 2-shinglings: sets of bigrams. Thus, we can use the Jaccard index to assess the similarity of our comments-as-2-shinglings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the Jaccard index is equal to the number of elements two sets have in common, divided by the total number of elements in both sets. The Jaccard index will be a value from 0 (sets have nothing in common—in the jargon, they're \"disjoint\") to 1 (sets are equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the Jaccard index of two sets A and B is given by \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "J(A,B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To briefly describe the mathematical notation, in the numerator of the fraction, the operator (∩) between A and B is the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)) operator—it yields the set of all elements that are in both A and B. The two bars (||) on either side of the intersection denote the [number of elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) in the intersection. The denominator is very similar, except it features the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)) operator (∪), which is the set of all elements that are contained either in A, or in B, or in both A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what this means for our comments A, B, and C by our comments-as-2-shinglings in Venn diagrams. In particular, let's look at the Venn diagram for comments A and B, and comments A and C. Then, we'll compute the Jaccard indices between A and B and between A and C."

    "## How Computers Work, Part II: Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already discussed how computers store and see data. But how do computers actually process data? That is, how do they *compute*? \n",
    "\n",
    "A full explanation of [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) is beyond the scope of this guide, but a basic understanding is helpful, so we'll cover a simplified model. As you may know, at the heart of all computers is the [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), or CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU is connected to the computer's [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory), typically RAM. At some point, all data will be loaded into memory, often from some secondary storage device, like a hard drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD). Memory might be analogized to a row of [lockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locker). We've all seen rows of lockers with big numbers on the front—addresses which identify the locker. And, within the locker, you can fit a fixed amount of stuff. You can change the contents of the locker, taking stuff out, putting stuff in. After some period of time, whether you like it or not, someone will clean out the lockers. This analogy illustrates several ideas about computer memory: data is stored at particular, numerical addresses. Each location in memory can contain a fixed amount of data. You can read and write data from/to memory at particular addresses. And, as is the case with [DRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory), memory can be remarkably ephemeral once the power goes out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the CPU itself, you'll find several more components: registers (which, for the most part, function similar to memory), the arithmetic logic unit (better known as the ALU, which performs, as the name suggests, arithmetical and logical operations), and the control unit (which coordinates between the ALU, memory, and input/output devices, telling them what operations to perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like data, the program—the set of instructions which the computer will execute—is also stored in memory. To run programs, the CPU follows the [instruction cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle). In short, a special register called the program counter (PC) stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. When it is time to execute that instruction, the CPU copies the contents of the PC into another register and then increments the PC, so that it again points to the next instruction to be executed. With the copy of the PC, the CPU can call up the instruction out of memory. Just the same as data, the instruction is represented as a binary number which is decoded by the control unit, which, depending on the instruction, might for example send a series of signals to the ALU to have it carry out some basic computation. (Note that on modern computers there tend to be other units similar to the ALU, like floating point units, which also carry out certain basic computations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions that a CPU can carry out are very basic. The ALU provides simple logical operations, for example the logical operation AND will return 1 if two bits are both 1, and 0 otherwise. The logical operation OR, meanwhile, returns 1 if either of two bits are 1, and 0 otherwise. The ALU also provides basic arithmetic like addition and subtraction. Other instructions, for which the control unit is ordinarily responsible, might copy or move data—for example, an instruction to load data from memory into a register is, on [some architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%E2%80%93store_architecture) (though probably not yours), a prerequisite for further processing of the data through the ALU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are thus two fundamental resources (sometimes colloquially referred to as \"compute\") that programmers tend to be very concerned about: instructions and memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are, fundamentally, a series of instructions. While high-level programming languages, like Python (which we've been using so far), let us easily write \"instructions\" that are far more complex than the basic instructions provided by the architecture of the computer, all programs, no matter the language, must ultimately be boiled down to those basic instructions. Importantly, a single CPU can only perform a single instruction at once (a slight oversimplification—especially as many computers are now [multicored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor)). And although operations are executed seemingly instantaneously, they actually require some miniscule amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different programs will need to execute a different number of instructions. The number of instructions that a program will need to execute may depend on the amount of data it takes as input. For example, imagine a simple program that takes as input a list of numbers and adds 1 to each number. In terms of the CPU, we might need operations to extract the each number from memory, increment it (an operation typically provided by the ALU), and return it to memory. And, remember, we would need to do this for each number in the list. As the list of numbers increases in length, the number of required operations also increases. If the list becomes extremely long, the seemingly instantaneous operations may become so numerous that, in bulk, they no longer seem instantaneous at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory, too, is be a limited resource. Programs are, as discussed, stored in memory, but so is the data over which the programs operate. Programs often require \"work memory,\" temporarily storing various values in memory so they can be referred to by some later operation in the program. It's neither the input nor the output—but memory usage in running the program. The amount of memory a program needs to execute may likewise scale with the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding two paragraphs introduce two central ideas of computer science: time complexity and space complexity, collectively referred to as [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, we'll focus on time complexity. The basic notion is this: there are different classes of programs. Some classes will require far more operations (and thus far more time) to complete than others as the size of the input increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some classes, the program will execute in the same amount of time no matter the size of the input. Imagine a program that accesses a single value from memory—no matter the size of the memory given as input, all it needs to do is retrieve the value stored at a particular address, and it happens in a single operation. We say these programs run in \"constant time.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In other classes, the time needed for the program to execute will scale linearly with the size of the input. Previously, we discussed a program that would add 1 to each number in a list of numbers. In such a program, each time another number is added to the list, the number of operations required will increase by a fixed amount. Such programs run in linear time. If the list is 500 numbers long, we will need 500*c* operations, where *c* is the number of operations required to increment a single number. If the list is *n* numbers long, we can write the number of operations required as *n*×*c*. But computer scientists would ordinarily just record this as *n*, or [O(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity is of great interest in the big data context because the data is, definitionally, big. Computational complexity asks (and provides a means to answering) how much time and memory a program will take as the input data increases in size. When you're dealing with huge input data, this is a very important question. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, even if you are not a computer scientist, you may have heard of computational complexity in other contexts before. For example, the iconic [P vs NP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) fundamentally asks whether all non-polynomial time algorithms (e.g., exponential time algorithms that might have, for example one that runs in O(2<sup>n</sup>)) can be rewritten as a much faster polynomial time algorithm (i.e., algorithms where the time complexity can be written as a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) like n<sup>4</sup>). A substantial part of the excitment around [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) is the ability to write quantum algorithms with significantly reduced [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Two: MinHash, Part II (The Actual MinHash Part) \n",
    "\n",
    "Building off the preceding section, let's consider the time complexity of directly computing the Jaccard index. As we know, we first need to compute the intersection of two sets A and B. Let's say we have an element in A, to determine whether the element is in the intersection of A and B, all we need to do is determine if the element is also in B. One option is to take that element in A, and compare it against every element of B, and ask whether the element is equal to any of those elements in B. To compute the full intersection with this approach, we would need to repeat this for every element in A. This is a quadratic time algorithm (siginificantly worse than the two classes of algorithms we discussed int he previous section): the number of operations with scale with the size of set A multiplied by the size of set B. Now, one might imagine faster ways of computing the Jaccard index, but it turns out there's a way of estimating the Jaccard index much faster than you could possibly compute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step toward understanding MinHash is visualizing sets not as Venn diagrams, but as a table (or, if you prefer a more mathematical term, a matrix). Given our three comments A, B, and C, our rows will represent every shingle in any of the three comments. Our columns will represent the three comments themselves. If a particular shingle appears in a comment, we'll mark the cell with a 1. If not, we'll mark the cell with a 0. Take a look:"
